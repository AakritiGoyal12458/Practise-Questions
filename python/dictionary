-1. Person: Use a dictionary to store information about a person you know.
Store their first name, last name, age, and the city in which they live. You 
should have keys such as first_name, last_name, age, and city. Print each 
piece of information stored in your dictionary.

6-2. Favorite Numbers: Use a dictionary to store people’s favorite numbers.
Think of five names, and use them as keys in your dictionary. Think of a favorite 
number for each person, and store each as a value in your dictionary. Print 
each person’s name and their favorite number. For even more fun, poll a few 
friends and get some actual data for your program.

6-3. Glossary: A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary.
However, to avoid confusion, let’s call it a glossary.
•	 Think of five programming words you’ve learned about in the previous 
chapters. Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store their 
meanings as values.
•	 Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. You might 
print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print the word 
on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. Use the 
newline character (\n) to insert a blank line between each word-meaning 
pair in your output.
